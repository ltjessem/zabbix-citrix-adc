# zabbix-citrix-adc
 
This template allows to monitor Citrix ADC (formerly known as Netscaler) load-balancers. It uses SNMP and low-level discovery to discover services, vservers and interfaces.  
Based on an old template found [here](https://share.zabbix.com/network_devices/citrix-netscaler/netscaler).
